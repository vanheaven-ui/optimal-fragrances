## üå∫ Overview

**Optimal Fragrances** is a modern **Next.js-powered perfume catalogue** designed to transform how small fragrance sellers showcase their collections online.  
Originally inspired by my brother‚Äôs side gig on WhatsApp where daily perfume posts were easily skipped by viewers This web app provides a **clean, central, and engaging experience** for customers to explore perfumes, read ratings, and place orders instantly via WhatsApp.

- Integrates **WhatsApp ordering** for a frictionless checkout experience.
- Empowers him with an **admin dashboard** to manage his products effortlessly.
